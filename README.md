task 1 
I used nmap(7.97) the ZenMap UI to find about the scanned ports services and hosts 

the ports that were found were: 21, 23,139,53,80,443,445 for the host 192.168.1.1

the ports found for host 192.168.1.63 were 135,139,445

services used by hosts found were <img width="1919" height="683" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d039a92d-8702-4304-94a2-8d389fbac813" />

this is the images when command used was nmap -p 1-65535 -T4 -A -v 192.168.1.0/24

Task2
I began by checking the sender’s display name and email address. In many phishing attempts, the sender’s name appears trustworthy, but the actual email domain is suspicious or fake. I looked for:

Mismatched names and email addresses

Typos or unusual domains

Use of free or unofficial domains

This helps identify spoofed senders — where attackers pretend to be legitimate companies.

Many phishing emails use urgency or threats to pressure the recipient into acting quickly. I analyzed the tone of the message for:

Phrases like “your account will be locked,” “immediate action required,” or “complete your profile now”

Attempts to create fear of missing out on a job or opportunity

Such emotional triggers are common tactics used by attackers.
